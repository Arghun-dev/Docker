# Docker

## What is Docker? 

Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications, in a consistent manner, so  if your application, works on your development machine, it can run and function in the same way on other machine.

If you are developing software for a while, you've probably come across to the situation, your application works on your development machine, but does not somewhere else.

## Why this happens?

1. One or more files missing
2. Software version mismatch (let's say your application needs Node version 14, but the target machine using Node version 9)
3. different configuration settings
